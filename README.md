# Scsh 0.6.7 Manual in GNU Texinfo Format

This is the Scsh 0.6.7 manual, converted to the Texinfo documentation
format.  It builds cleanly with HTML, Info, and PDF output.  This
includes all function and variable indices.

During the conversion I've lightly edited the manual in places, with
the following aims:

* Correct grammar and spelling

* Consistent use of terms (this is still underway; see the file
  `style-guide.org')

* Clean Texinfo builds
