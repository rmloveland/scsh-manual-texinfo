# Scsh 0.6.7 Manual in GNU Texinfo Format

This is a work in progress. Build it using the command

    makeinfo --html --force scsh.texi

The current status is that I've finally completed the main part of the
work. Conversion to Texinfo is complete, modulo `makeinfo' build
errors.

In the process of doing the conversion, I've edited some sections
*very slightly* in order to do the following:

* Correct grammar and spelling errors

* Use terms consistently (see the file `style-guide.org')

* Get Texinfo to stop screaming (it insists you use parenthetical
  notes in specific ways, for example)

* Use slightly more idiomatic English
