#+title: Style Guide

Follow these guidelines when editing the Texinfo-formatted version of
the scsh manual.

* The name of scsh

  The name of scsh is apparently lowercased. Please change all
  references to reflect this.

* Scsh/Scheme 48 Records

  Mentions of scsh record names or fields will use the @code{} notation.

* Capitalization

  Procedure and macro names will be capitalized if they appear at the
  beginning of a sentence.

* Procedure return values

  All procedure definition blocks will show a return value. (This is
  currently not the case, and needs to be fixed.)

* Book Titles

  Book titles will use `@emph{}'.

* Miscellaneous Conventions

  - `filename' is one word; `file name' and `file-name' will not be
    used except in procedure and variable names.

  - Paragraphs are filled using M-q. Auto-fill-mode may have
    unexpected results on code examples.

  - Sections marked `Note' use simple emphasis only.
